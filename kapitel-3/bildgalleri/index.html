                <h3>Hubble and the Moon</h3>
                <p>One of the STS-103 astronauts inside Discovery's cabin took this
                    image of the full moon backdropped against the blackness of space
                    over Earth's horizon. The top of the berthed Hubble Space Telescope (HST) appears in the frame.</p>

                <h3>2017 Total Solar Eclipse</h3>
                <p>During the total solar eclipse, the Sun’s corona, only visible during the total eclipse, is shown as
                    a crown of white flares from the surface. The red spots called Bailey's beads occurs where the moon
                    grazes by the Sun and the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in
                    some areas as photographed from NASA Armstrong’s Gulfstream III. Photo Credit: (NASA/Carla Thomas)

                <h3>Astronaut Harrison Schmitt Collects Lunar Rake Samples</h3>
                <p>Scientist-astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt, lunar module pilot, collects lunar rake samples at Station 1
                    during the first Apollo 17 extravehicular activity (EVA) at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. This
                    picture was taken by astronaut Eugene Cernan, commander. The lunar rake, an Apollo lunar geology
                    hand
                    tool, is used to collect discrete samples of rocks and rock chips ranging in size from one- half
                    inch
                    (1.3 centimeter) to one inch (2.5 centimeter).</p>

                <h3>Earth Moon</h3>
                <p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft took this image of Earth's Moon on Dec. 7, 1992, on its way to explore the
                    Jupiter system in 1995-97. The distinct bright ray crater at the bottom of the image is the Tycho
                    impact basin. </p>
