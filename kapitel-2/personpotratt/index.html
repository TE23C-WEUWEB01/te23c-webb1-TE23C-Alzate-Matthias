    <p>Alexander (June 1, 1999 – June 2022[a]), known online as Technoblade (/ˈtɛk.noʊˌbleɪd/ TEK-noh-blayd), was an
        American YouTuber known for his Minecraft videos, livestreams, and involvement in the Dream SMP. Technoblade
        registered his main channel on YouTube in 2013. His videos consisted primarily of Minecraft gameplay,
        particularly on the minigame server Hypixel. After rising to popularity in 2019 for his performances in player
        versus player (PvP) events, Technoblade was invited to the Dream SMP Minecraft server in 2020, further
        increasing his following. <br>

        In August 2021, Technoblade announced his diagnosis with cancer. Following unsuccessful treatment attempts,
        Technoblade died from metastatic sarcoma in June 2022,[b] which prompted widespread reactions across both the
        Minecraft and YouTube communities. At the time of his death, his main YouTube channel had reached nearly 11
        million subscribers.[2]</p>
