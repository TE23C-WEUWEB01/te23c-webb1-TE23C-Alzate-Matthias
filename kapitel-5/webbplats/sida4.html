        <p>Yorushika (ヨルシカ) is a Japanese rock duo founded in 2017 represented by Universal Music Japan. The group is composed of N-buna, a vocaloid music producer, and Suis, a female vocalist. They are known for their juxtaposition of "passionate" and "upbeat" production and instrumentation fused with heavier lyrical content, which often explore ideas such as love and human emotion and draw from works of literature including Masuji Ibuse and Jules Verne. The name "Yorushika" is taken from a lyric in their song "The Clouds and the Ghost"; "yoru shika mō nemurezu ni" (夜しかもう眠れずに, meaning "I can't sleep at night"). The eye-designed logo mark is a motif of two moons facing each other and also serves as a clock hand, portraying the time "from 6:00 to night".</p>

        <p>The duo is extremely secretive, never publicly revealing their faces. N-buna stated that he doesn't want the creator to take precedence over the work.</p>
