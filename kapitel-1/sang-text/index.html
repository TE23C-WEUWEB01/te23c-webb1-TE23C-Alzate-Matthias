    <h1>Wake Me Up</h1>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>

    <p>Feeling my way through the darkness <br>
        Guided by a beating heart <br>
        I can't tell where the journey will end <br>
        But I know where to start <br>
        They tell me I'm too young to understand <br>
        They say I'm caught up in a dream <br>
        Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes <br>
        Well that's fine by me</p>

    <p>So wake me up when it's all over <br>
        When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
        All this time I was finding myself, and I <br>
        Didn't know I was lost</p>

    <p>So wake me up when it's all over <br>
        When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
        All this time I was finding myself, and I <br>
        Didn't know I was lost</p>

    <p>I tried carrying the weight of the world <br>
        But I only have two hands <br>
        Hope I get the chance to travel the world <br>
        But I don't have any plans <br>
        Wish that I could stay forever this young <br>
        Not afraid to close my eyes <br>
        Life's a game made for everyone <br>
        And love is a prize</p>

    <p>So wake me up when it's all over <br>
        When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
        All this time I was finding myself, and I <br>
        Didn't know I was lost</p>

    <p>So wake me up when it's all over <br>
        When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
        All this time I was finding myself, and I <br>
        I didn't know I was lost</p>

    <p>I didn't know I was lost <br>
        I didn't know I was lost <br>
        I didn't know I was lost <br>
        I didn't know</p>

        <p><strong>"Wake Me Up"</strong> is a song by Swedish DJ and record producer Avicii, released as the lead single from his debut studio album True, released on CD by PRMD Music and Island Records on 17 June 2013. It was written by Avicii, Mike Einziger, and American soul singer Aloe Blacc, who provides vocals for the track.[1][2] Mike Einziger of Incubus provides acoustic guitar, while Peter Dyer provides keyboard on the song.</p>

        <p>Avicii introduced "Wake Me Up!" for the first time live on stage at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. The experimental rendering (it was accompanied by a live band with instruments and vocalists, including Blacc, Einziger and Incubus members Ben Kenney on bass and Jos√© Pasillas on drums)[3] reportedly confused and angered a section of the electronic dance festival community.[4][5] Subsequently, Avicii achieved critical and commercial success with the release of the single worldwide.</p>

        <p>"Wake Me Up" has been named as the highest charting dance track of the 2010s,[6] sitting at No. 13 in the 100-strong list from the official UK Singles Chart. It is the only song to crack the Billboard Decade-End without making the top 3 during any week.[7] It also reached number one in much of Europe and charted well in various countries.</p>

        <p>The song has been described as a "summer anthem"[8] by Variance Magazine and, throughout the 2013 festival season, Avicii included it as part of the opening or closing sequence of his sets at EDC Las Vegas, EDC London, Tomorrowland, Creamfields, Electric Zoo and the iTunes Festival.[9] Due to the success of the song, Blacc later released an acoustic version of "Wake Me Up" in his solo EP Wake Me Up. It was also released as a promotional stand-alone single on Interscope Records, made available online for downloads via iTunes. A separate music video was also made. The Blacc single also charted on various charts.</p>
